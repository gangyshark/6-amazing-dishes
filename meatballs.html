                        <li>In a mixing bowl, mix ground beef, onion, peppers, cheese, salt, pepper, parsley, and eggs. </li>
                        <li>Once they're all mixed together, roll them into meatballs to whatever size you want them to be, and then place them on a sheet tray that is oven safe and has either olive oil, or a non-stick spray, sprayed onto the pan. </li>
                        <li>Put the meatballs in the oven for 18 to 20 minutes. Break one open and if it isnt' pink they're good to eat, but if they're still pink then leave in the oven until they're no longer pink.</li>   
                        <li>Take out and mix with spaghetti, or put them on a sub and have a meatball sub</li>
